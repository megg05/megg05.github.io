## details
Sidepods for this racecar were designed with two primary purposes:
1. Creating downforce and reducing drag, especially from turbulent air in the wake of the car's front wing.
2. Cooling the engine and electronics by channeling airflow through two radiators.
Surface modelling in Siemens NX enabled iteration of the sidepod shape, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis in STAR-CCM+ identified what designs produced the largest coefficient of lift for maximal downforce. CFD also contributed to integration with the cooling subsystem in identifying radiator shape, mounting position, and angle that was most conducive to efficient airflow and fastest cooling. Accomplishing these two goals:
1. improved traction from tires with increased downforce and 
2. raised the thermal operating limit for motors and electrical components with efficient cooling.
Manufacturing was carried out with foam core molds and carbon fiber wet layups.

## additional FSAE work
After this model year, I have worked on software controls and vehicle simulation, which have allowed me to incorporate my aerodynamics experience in optimizing performance of the car. Through simulation work, I evaluate vehicle performance and the impact of thermal cooling capabilities, aerostructure design, and contributions of all other subsystems of the car.
