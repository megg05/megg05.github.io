## details
This project was conducted with the Assistive Technology club at MIT, and sought to address the concerns of an individual with ankle-foot prostheses. Since these concerns focused mainly on frequent breakage, we used FEA to design sole and brace shapes that would distribute pressure across the prosthetic instead of concentrating stress at weak points. Manufacturing methods involved carbon fiber layups that required testing to find a balance between flexibility to maintain a natural gait and rigidity to give her necessary support. In addition, we prioritized a sleek design that would not interfere with mobility in her daily life.
