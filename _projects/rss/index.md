## details
This project involved design and implementation of algorithms on a mobile robot for 6.4200 (Robotics: Science and Systems) in spring 2025. As a team, we developed a platform capable of autonomous navigation in a mapped environment via state estimation and motion planning. This required accurate control of Ackermann steering and efficient use of the robot's sensing capabilities (camera and LiDAR). I focused on implementation of classical control pathways and modelling vehicle dynamics to ensure stable execution of planned trajectories.
